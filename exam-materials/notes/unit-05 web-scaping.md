### Basic Points on Web Scraping Using Python

- Web scraping is a technique used to extract data from websites.

#### 1. **Understand the Website's Structure**

- Inspect the HTML structure of the website to identify the data you want to scrape.
- Use browser developer tools (right-click on the page and select "Inspect" or press F12) to explore the HTML elements.

#### 2. **Python Libraries for Web Scraping**

- **Requests**:
  - Used to send HTTP requests to a website and retrieve the HTML content.
- **BeautifulSoup**:
  - Used to parse the HTML and extract the desired data.
- **lxml**:
  - Another library for parsing HTML and XML documents.
- **Selenium**:
  - Used for scraping dynamic content generated by JavaScript.

#### 3. **Basic Workflow**

   1. **Send a Request**: Use the `requests` library to get the HTML content of the webpage.
   2. **Parse HTML**: Use `BeautifulSoup` or `lxml` to parse the HTML content.
   3. **Extract Data**: Navigate through the HTML structure and extract the required data.
   4. **Store Data**: Save the extracted data to a file or database.
