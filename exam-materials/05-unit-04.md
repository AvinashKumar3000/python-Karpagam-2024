    - A file pointer, also known as a file position, is an internal marker that indicates the current position within a file.
11. How can you check the current file position in Python?
    - To check the current file position in Python, you can use the tell() method of the file object.

1. Write a Python program to read a file and display its contents along with the line number for each line.  
1. Write a program to copy the contents of one file to another.  

### **Topic: Decorators**  

#### **2-Mark Questions**  

1. What is a decorator in Python?

1. What is the difference between a regular function and a decorator?  
1. What is the advantage of using decorators in Python?  
1. Write a simple example of a decorator.  


### **40 Two-Marks Questions on OOP Topics**  

1. Define Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
     - Is a computer programming style that organizes software around objects, rather than functions and logic
1. List any two advantages of OOP over procedural programming.  
    - security
    - flexible
    - scalable
    - code consistency
1. What is a class in Python?
    - a class is a template or blueprint for creating objects
1. What is an object in OOP?
    - An instance of a class is called object.
1. Define inheritance and state its significance.  
    - Like real life example, we humans inherites properties from our parents.
    - Same Here in python, we can inherite attributes and methods of parent class to child class.
    - This process of inheriting properties of parent class to child class is called inheritance.
1. List types of inheritance?
1. What is single inheritance?
1. What is multiple inheritance?  
1. Explain hierarchical inheritance with an example.  
1. What is data abstraction?  
1. How is abstraction implemented in Python?  
1. Differentiate between abstraction and encapsulation.  
1. Define encapsulation.  
1. What is polymorphism in OOP?  
1. Give an example of polymorphism in Python.  
1. What is the role of the `__init__` method in a Python class?  
1. Why is the `self` parameter required in Python methods?  
1. What are instance variables?  
1. Differentiate between instance variables and class variables.  
1. What are static methods in Python?  
1. What is the purpose of class methods?  
1. Define method overloading.
     - python doesn't support method overloading directly.
     - But we can achieve that using default-argument/ var-argument/ var-keyword-arguments 
1. Define method overriding with an example.
     - a method in child class over-rides the functionality of method in parent class.
1. What is operator overloading?  
1. What is the purpose of a UML class diagram?  
    - UML diagrams, particularly Class Diagrams.
    - play a crucial role in visualizing the static structure of a software system. 
1. Name the components of a UML class diagram.
    - Structural components
    - Relational components
1. What are access specifiers?
    - way to control access of variables and methods
1. List the types of access specifiers in Python.
    - private, public, protected.
1. What is the difference between public and private members in Python?
    - public: access inside class, inside subclass and outside class
    - private: access only inside class.
1. How do you define a protected member in Python?
    - variable starting with single underscore '_a' 
1. What is the purpose of the `super()` function?
    - to call parent class constructor.
1. Differentiate between `super()` and accessing the parent class directly.  
1. What is the purpose of the `dir()` function in the context of a class?  
1. Explain the concept of constructor in Python.  
1. How do you define a destructor in Python?  
1. What is a dynamic method in Python?  
1. How does Python handle multiple inheritance conflicts?  
1. What is the difference between `isinstance()` and `issubclass()`?  
1. Define the importance of the `self` parameter in Python class methods.
