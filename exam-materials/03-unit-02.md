1. Implement a program to find all occurrences of a given pattern in a string. Explain how pattern matching works in the solution.  

Here’s a Python program to find all occurrences of a given pattern in a string using the `find()` method. This method allows pattern matching and helps locate the positions where the pattern appears in the string.

### **Solution**

```python
def find_pattern_occurrences(text, pattern):
    # List to store the starting positions of each occurrence
    positions = []
    
    # Starting index to search for the pattern
    start = 0
    
    while start < len(text):
        # Find the pattern in the string starting from the current 'start' index
        position = text.find(pattern, start)
        
        # If the pattern is found, add its position to the list and move the start index forward
        if position != -1:
            positions.append(position)
            start = position + 1  # Move the start index after the current found pattern
        else:
            break  # If no more occurrences, exit the loop
    
    return positions

# Example usage
text = "ababcababc"
pattern = "ab"
positions = find_pattern_occurrences(text, pattern)

# Print the result
if positions:
    print(f"Pattern '{pattern}' found at positions: {positions}")
else:
    print(f"Pattern '{pattern}' not found.")
```

### **Explanation**

1. **Function Definition:**
   - The `find_pattern_occurrences` function accepts two parameters: `text` (the string in which we search) and `pattern` (the string we want to find in the text).

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - An empty list `positions` is created to store the starting index of each occurrence of the pattern.
   - The variable `start` is set to 0 to start the search from the beginning of the string.

3. **While Loop:**
   - The `while` loop continues until the `start` index exceeds the length of the string. It uses the `find()` method to search for the `pattern` starting from the `start` index.
   - If the pattern is found, its index is appended to the `positions` list, and the `start` index is moved forward by 1 to search for subsequent occurrences.
   - If the pattern is not found (`find()` returns `-1`), the loop breaks.

4. **Return:**
   - The function returns a list of indices where the pattern occurs in the text.

### **Example Output:**

For the input:

```text = "ababcababc"```

```pattern = "ab"```

The output will be:

```
Pattern 'ab' found at positions: [0, 3, 6, 9]
```

### **How Pattern Matching Works:**

- The `find()` method searches for the specified substring (pattern) in the string and returns the index of the first occurrence. It starts searching from the specified index (here, the `start` variable).
- By adjusting the `start` index after each match, the program can find all occurrences of the pattern in the string.
