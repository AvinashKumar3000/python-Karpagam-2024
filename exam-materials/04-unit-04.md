### Access Specifiers in Python: Basic Notes

In Python, access specifiers control the visibility of class members (attributes and methods). Python provides three levels of access control: **public**, **protected**, and **private**. However, Python doesn't enforce strict access control like other languages (e.g., Java, C++). Instead, it relies on naming conventions.

---

#### **1. Public Access**

- **Default Access Specifier**: All class members are public by default.
- **Visibility**: Accessible from anywhere (inside and outside the class).

**Syntax**: simply create a variable without using any underscore.

**Example**:

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Alice"  # Public attribute

    def display(self): # Public method as it is not starting with any underscore.
        print("Student Name:", self.name)  

# Accessing public members
obj = Student()
print(obj.name)  # accessing public attribute outside the class
obj.display()    # accessing public method outside the class
```

---

#### **2. Protected Access**

- **Naming Convention**: Prefix the member name with a single underscore `_`.
- **Visibility**: Accessible within the class and its subclasses. However, it can still be accessed outside the class (not strictly enforced).

**Example**:

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self):
        self._name = "Alice"  # Protected attribute

    def _display(self): # Protected method as it is starting with one underscore.
        print("Student Name:", self._name)  

class Child(Student):
    def show_name(self):
        print("student name",self._name) # accessing inside its child class. ( possible )

# Accessing protected members
obj = Student()
print(obj.name)  # accessing public attribute outside the class
obj.display()    # accessing public method outside the class
```

---

#### **3. Private Access**

- **Naming Convention**: Prefix the member name with double underscores `__`.
- **Visibility**: Accessible only within the class. Private members are name-mangled to prevent direct access outside the class.

**Example**:

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.__name = name  # Private attribute

    def __display(self):  # Private method
        print(f"Student Name: {self.__name}")

    def show_name(self):  # Public method to access private members
        self.__display()

# Accessing private members
s = Student("Charlie")
# print(s.__name)  # Error: Attribute not accessible directly
s.show_name()  # Accessing private method via a public method
```

**Note on Name Mangling**:  
Python changes the name of private members to `_ClassName__attributeName`. You can access them directly if needed (not recommended).  

```python
print(s._Student__name)  # Works but not advised
```

---

#### **Key Points**

1. **Public**: Default access, accessible from anywhere.  
2. **Protected**: Indicated by `_`, accessible within the class and subclasses.  
3. **Private**: Indicated by `__`, restricted to the class using name mangling.  

Python emphasizes developer responsibility rather than enforcing strict access rules.

### UML Class Diagram: Basic Notes

#### **Definition**

A UML (Unified Modeling Language) class diagram represents the structure of a system by illustrating its classes, attributes, methods, and the relationships between the classes.

---

#### **Components of a Class Diagram**

1. **Class**
   - Represents an entity in the system.
   - Drawn as a rectangle divided into three sections:
     - **Top Section**: Class Name
     - **Middle Section**: Attributes (variables or properties of the class)
     - **Bottom Section**: Methods (functions or behaviors of the class)

2. **Attributes**
   - Represent the properties of the class.
   - Syntax: `visibility name: type`

3. **Methods**
   - Represent the behaviors or operations a class can perform.
   - Syntax: `visibility name(parameters): returnType`

---

#### **Access Specifiers in UML**

Access specifiers indicate the visibility of class attributes and methods.

| Symbol | Access Specifier | Description                                        |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `+`    | Public           | The attribute or method is accessible from any class. |
| `-`    | Private          | The attribute or method is accessible only within the same class. |
| `#`    | Protected        | The attribute or method is accessible within the class and its subclasses. |

---

#### **Example: UML Class Diagram**

```
-----------------------------------
|      Student                    |
-----------------------------------
| - name: String                  |
| - age: int                      |
| - rollNumber: int               |
-----------------------------------
| + getName(): String             |
| + setName(name: String): void   |
| + calculateGrade(): String      |
-----------------------------------
```

### **40 Two-Marks Questions on OOP Topics**  

1. Define Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
     - Is a computer programming style that organizes software around objects, rather than functions and logic
1. List any two advantages of OOP over procedural programming.  
    - security
    - flexible
    - scalable
    - code consistency
1. What is a class in Python?
    - a class is a template or blueprint for creating objects
1. What is an object in OOP?
    - An instance of a class is called object.
1. Define inheritance and state its significance.  
    - Like real life example, we humans inherites properties from our parents.
    - Same Here in python, we can inherite attributes and methods of parent class to child class.
    - This process of inheriting properties of parent class to child class is called inheritance.
1. List types of inheritance?
1. What is single inheritance?
1. What is multiple inheritance?  
1. Explain hierarchical inheritance with an example.  
1. What is data abstraction?  
1. How is abstraction implemented in Python?
    - using a module 'abc'
    - Where abc means abstract base class.  
1. Differentiate between abstraction and encapsulation.  
1. Define encapsulation.  
1. What is polymorphism in OOP?
   - there are 2 types of polymorphism they are overloading and overriding.
   - overloading : a single function can handle differently for different input types/behaviours
   - overriding : a proccess of overriding parent class method in child class.
1. What is the role of the `__init__` method in a Python class?  
1. Why is the `self` parameter required in Python methods?  
1. What are instance variables?
    - Inside a class any variable declared using self is called instance variable.
    - This variables belongs to that object only.
1. Differentiate between instance variables and class variables.
    - instance variable : belongs to object/instance of a class
    - class    variable : belongs to class, which mean, it is shared accross all objects.
1. What are static methods in Python?
    - static methods are methods
1. What is the purpose of class methods?  
1. Define method overloading.
     - python doesn't support method overloading directly.
     - But we can achieve that using default-argument/ var-argument/ var-keyword-arguments
1. Define method overriding with an example.
     - a method in child class over-rides the functionality of method in parent class.

    - Relational components
1. What are access specifiers?
    - way to control access of variables and methods
1. List the types of access specifiers in Python.
    - private, public, protected.
1. What is the difference between public and private members in Python?
    - public: access inside class, inside subclass and outside class
    - private: access only inside class.
1. How do you define a protected member in Python?
    - variable starting with single underscore '_a'
1. What is the purpose of the `super()` function?
    - to call parent class constructor.
