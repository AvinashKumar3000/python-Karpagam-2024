1. What is the `unittest` module used for in Python?  ( 2 mark )

        - The unittest module in Python is used for writing and running tests.
        - It provides a framework for creating test cases, running tests, and reporting results. 
        - It supports 
            - test automation, 
            - sharing of setup and shutdown code for tests, 
            - aggregation of tests into collections, 
            - and independence of the tests from the reporting framework.

1. How do you write a basic test case using the `unittest` module?  ( 2 mark )

        - To write a basic test case using the unittest module, 
        - you need to:
            - Import the unittest module.
            - Create a class that inherits from unittest.TestCase.
            - Define test methods within the class. 
           
    ```python
    import unittest
    
    class TestMathOperations(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_addition(self):
            self.assertEqual(1 + 1, 2)
    
    unittest.main()
    ```

1. What is the role of assertions in unit testing?  ( 2 mark )

        - Assertions in unit testing are used to check if a condition is true. 
        - If the condition is false, the assertion fails, 
        - and the test case is marked as failed. 
        - Assertions help verify that the code produces the expected results. 
        - unittest provides various assertion methods like     
            - assertEqual(), 
            - assertTrue(), 
            - assertFalse(), 
            - assertRaises(), etc.

1. What is the purpose of the `setUp()` and `tearDown()` methods in unit testing?  ( 2 mark )

        - The setUp() 
            - method is used to set up any state or resources needed for the tests. 
            - It runs before each test method. 
        - The tearDown() 
            - method is used to clean up any resources or state after each test method. 
            - These methods help ensure that each test runs in isolation and does not affect other tests.

    ```python
    import unittest
    
    class TestMathOperations(unittest.TestCase):
        def setUp(self):
            self.a = 10
            self.b = 5
    
        def tearDown(self):
            pass  # Clean-up code can go here if needed
    
        def test_addition(self):
            self.assertEqual(self.a + self.b, 15)
    
    unittest.main()
    
    ```

1. Explain the difference between `assertEqual()` and `assertNotEqual()` in `unittest`.  ( 2 mark )

        - assertEqual(a, b): 
            - Asserts that a is equal to b. The test passes if the values are equal.
        - assertNotEqual(a, b): 
            - Asserts that a is not equal to b. The test passes if the values are not equal.
        - These methods are used to check for expected and unexpected values in your test cases.
        

1. What is BeautifulSoup used for in web scraping?   ( 2 mark )

        - BeautifulSoup is a Python library used for parsing HTML and XML documents. 
        - It creates a parse tree from the page source code, 
        - which allows for easy extraction of data using various selectors and methods. 
        - BeautifulSoup is especially helpful in navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree, 
        - making it simpler to access and manipulate specific elements within the HTML structure.

1. Explain the concept of "crawling" in web scraping. 1. What is BeautifulSoup used for in web scraping? ( 2 marks )

        - Crawling refers to the automated process of systematically browsing and indexing web pages. 
        - It involves following links from one page to another, 
        - collecting data from each page, 
        - and storing it for later analysis. 
        - Web crawlers, also known as spiders or bots, are used to traverse the web, 
        - discovering and scraping information from multiple pages in a structured manner.

1. What is web scraping in Python, and what libraries can be used for it? ( 2 mark + 4 mark )

        - Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. 
        - It involves retrieving the HTML content of a web page 
        - and parsing it to extract the required information.

        Libraries commonly used for web scraping in Python:        
            - Requests: For sending HTTP requests to fetch web pages.
            - BeautifulSoup: For parsing HTML and XML documents and extracting data.
            - lxml: For fast and powerful HTML and XML parsing.
            - Selenium: For automating web browsers, useful for scraping dynamic content.
            - Scrapy: A powerful and flexible web scraping framework.

1. What is the purpose of `requests` library in web scraping?  

        - The requests library is used to send HTTP requests to a webpage
        - And retrieve the HTML content. 
        - It simplifies the process of following items
           * making web requests, 
           * handling cookies, 
           * sessions, 
           * and managing response status codes.

1. Define data analysis. ( 2 mark + 8 mark )

        Data analysis is the process of 
            - inspecting, 
            - cleaning, 
            - transforming, 
            - and modeling data 
        to discover useful information,  

        - It involves applying statistical and logical techniques
          to summarize, understand, and interpret data. 
        - Data analysis helps identify 
            - patterns, 
            - trends, 
            - and relationships within the data
        
        Key Points:
        ----------        
        Inspection: 
            - Examining the data to understand its structure and content.
        Cleaning: 
            - Removing or correcting any inaccuracies or inconsistencies in the data.
        Transformation: 
            - Converting data into a suitable format for analysis.
        Modeling: 
            - Applying statistical or machine learning models to analyze data.
        Interpretation: 
            - Drawing meaningful insights and conclusions from the analysis.
        
        This process is different from data processing, 
        which generally refers to the initial steps of preparing raw data for analysis.
