### **Topic: Packages: Defining, Creating, and Accessing a Package**

#### **2-Mark Questions**

### 1. What is a module?  

A **module** in Python is a file containing Python code (functions, classes, variables) that can be reused in other programs by importing it.  
**Example:** `math`, `os`.  

---

### 2. List some in-built modules  

Python includes built-in modules like `math`, `os`, `sys`, `random`, and `datetime`.

---

### 3. What is a package in Python?  

A **package** in Python is a directory containing multiple modules and a special `__init__.py` file to initialize the package.

---

### 4. How do you create a package in Python?  

1. Create a directory with the package name.  
2. Add a `__init__.py` file (can be empty).  
3. Add module files (e.g., `module1.py`, `module2.py`) inside the directory.

---

### 5. What is the purpose of the `__init__.py` file in a Python package?  

The `__init__.py` file indicates that the directory is a Python package and can include initialization code.

---

### 6. How do you import a module from a package?  

Use the syntax `import package_name.module_name`.  
**Example:** `import mypackage.mymodule`.

---

### 7. What is the difference between a module and a package in Python?  

- A **module** is a single file containing Python code.  
- A **package** is a collection of modules organized in a directory with an `__init__.py` file.

---

### 8. How can you access a function from a module in a package?  

Import the module and access the function using `package_name.module_name.function_name`.  
**Example:** `mypackage.mymodule.myfunction()`.

---

### 9. What is the use of the `from <package> import <module>` syntax?  

It allows you to import specific modules or items from a package for direct use.  
**Example:** `from mypackage import mymodule`.  

---

#### `8-Mark Questions`

### 1. Steps Involved in Creating and Using a Python Package

To create and use a Python package, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Create a Package Directory  

- Create a directory for the package. The directory name will be the package name.  

#### Step 2: Add `__init__.py` File  

- Create an `__init__.py` file inside the package directory.  
- This file can be empty or contain initialization code for the package.  

#### Step 3: Add Module Files  

- Add `.py` files (modules) inside the package directory. Each file should define functions, classes, or variables.  

#### Step 4: Import and Use the Package  

- Import the package and its modules using `import` or `from ... import ...` syntax.  
- Call the functions or use classes from the package.  

---

### 2. Python Program to Demonstrate Creating a Package with Multiple Modules  

### 3. Write a program that defines a package with two modules and demonstrates how to import and use them in another script

#### Directory Structure  

```
mypackage/
    __init__.py
    math_operations.py
    string_operations.py
main.py
```

#### Step 1: Define the Package  

**`mypackage/__init__.py`:**  

```python
# This file initializes the package
print("mypackage has been initialized")
```

**`mypackage/math_operations.py`:**  

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b
```

**`mypackage/string_operations.py`:**  

```python
def to_uppercase(string):
    return string.upper()

def to_lowercase(string):
    return string.lower()
```

---

#### Step 2: Use the Package  

**`main.py`:**  

```python
# Importing the modules from the package
from mypackage import math_operations, string_operations

# Using math_operations module
print("Addition:", math_operations.add(10, 5))
print("Subtraction:", math_operations.subtract(10, 5))

# Using string_operations module
print("Uppercase:", string_operations.to_uppercase("hello"))
print("Lowercase:", string_operations.to_lowercase("WORLD"))
```

---

#### Output  

```
mypackage has been initialized
Addition: 15
Subtraction: 5
Uppercase: HELLO
Lowercase: world
```

---

### Explanation  

1. **Package Creation:** The `mypackage` directory contains the `__init__.py` file, indicating it is a package.  
2. **Modules:** The `math_operations.py` and `string_operations.py` files contain specific functionality.  
3. **Usage:** The `main.py` file demonstrates importing and using the package modules.  

---

1. Discuss the role and structure of the `__init__.py` file in Python packages. Provide an example.  
1. Demonstrate how to use the `import` statement to access functions from different modules within a package.
