#### `computer introduction`

üí° what is computer ?

    computer is a computing device.

üí° why it is called as computer ?

    As computer are mainly build for computing purpose, Hence it is called as computer.
    üí≠ who is father of computer ? charles babage. 
    Why he is called as father of computer ? because he is the one who invented first working computer which will do math calculation.

[Charles babbage first computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlbQsKpq3Ak&t=177s)

## computer

- A computer is an electronic device
- It operates under the control of instructions.

## Functionalities of computer

- takes data as input
- stores the data/instructions in its memory and use them when required.
- process the data and converts it into useful information
- generates the output

## computer components

- Every computers consists of hardware and software.
- software example : Photo shop, VSCode etc.
  
## hardware

- computer hardware is the collection of physical elements that builds a computer system.
- Computer hardware refers to the physical elements that builds a computer system.
- computer hardware refers to the physical parts or components of a computer such as the monitor, mouse, keyboard, computer data storage, hard drive disk ( HDD), system unit(graphic cards, sound cards, memory, motherboard and chips ). and lot more. All of which are physical objects that can be touched.

### input devices

- input devices are essential for interacting with a computer allowing us to input data commands and other information.
- input device translate data from that human understand to one that the computer can work with most common are keyboard and mouse.
- Example for input devices are : keyboard, mouse, joystick, microphone, numeric keyboard, camera, webcame.

### Output devices

- output devices are essential for conveying information from the computer to the user.
- output devices converts the electronically generated information into human readable form.
- Example of output devices are: CRT monitor, Speakers, Printers, projector.
  
#### `Language introduction`

- üè∑Ô∏è Python is an interpreter language.
- üè∑Ô∏è Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.
- üè∑Ô∏è Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.
- üè∑Ô∏è Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected.
- üè∑Ô∏è It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming.

#### `Introduction to IDLE`

- IDLE - Integrated Development and Learning Environment

#### `Difference between Compiler & interpreter`

- A teacher and student example üí≠
- A teacher ask to write an essay about "AIM IN LIFE"
- After completing the essay, He gave his an essay to teacher for correction.
- The teacher say a mistake in first line, Hence student went and corrected the mistake.
- After correction, again ...
- So the point is executing line by line is interpreter.
- First check for all error then executing is compiler.

#### `Assignment operator intro`

- assignment operator in python.
- Here `=` is not about assigning value to a variable. It is actually reference.
- In python there is no concept called pointer.

```python
a = 123
b = 123
print(id(a)) #  140714564323576
print(id(b)) #  140714564323576
```

#### `input and print function`

##### `Input`

###### Formats that can be asked in problem solving

###### basic single values

    input: 1
    code: int(input())
    
    input: 12.12
    code: float(input())
    
    input: Hello world
    code: input()

##### multiple values in single line

###### input format

```md
example 1: 1 2 3 4 5
example 2: 12 212 23
example 3: 1.23 2.12 43.3 43.3
example 4: hari jai krish mani   
```

##### `CODE`

```python
# example 1:
# input: 1 2 3 4 5
li = list(map(int,input().split()))
# example 2: 
# input: 12 212 23
li = list(map(int,input().split()))
# example 3: 
# input: 1.23 2.12 43.3 43.3
li = list(map(float,input().split()))
# example 4:
# input: hari jai krish mani   
li = input().split()
```

```python
# input: 12 23 34 53 53
# code example 1
li = list(map(int,input().split()))
# code example 2
li = []
temp = input().split()
for item in temp:
    li.append(int(item))
print(li) # [12, 23, 34, 53, 53]
# code example 3
li = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
print(li) # [12, 23, 34, 53, 53]
```

##### combining n and list items

```md
input: 
5
11 2 23 4 56 6
```

```python
# code example
n = int(input())
li = list(map(int,input().split()))
print(n) # 5
print(li) # [11, 2, 23, 4, 56, 6]
```

##### matrix input example

```md
input:
3 4
11 22 33 44
10 20 30 40
17 17 17 17 
```

```python
# code example
temp = list(map(int,input().split()))
rc = temp[0]
cc = temp[1]
matrix = []
for i in range(rc):
    row = list(map(int,input().split()))
    matrix.append(row)
```

---

### `Print`

```python
    
# print(*args, sep=' ', end='\n')
#     *args
#       which means you can pass any number of values.
#     sep
#       string inserted between values, default a space.
#     end
#       string appended after the last value, default a newline.
#     
```

example 1

```python
li = ['samsung', 'iphone','nokia','oppo','vivo']
print(*li,sep=" and ")
# samsung and iphone and nokia and oppo and vivo 
```

example 2

```python
li = [1,2,3,4]
n = len(li)
for i in range(n):
   print(li[i],end=",")
#  1,2,3,4,
```

#### `Arithmetic operator`

### operators and data types

#### operators precedence and associativity

|precedence  |    operator  |associativity  |
|-------|---------|---------|
|1      |   ()    |      L-R   |
|2      |   x[index], x[index:index]     | L-R        |
|3      |   **      | R-L         |
|4      |   +x, -x, ~x     ( bitwise )    | R-L         |
|5      |   *, /, //, %      |      L-R    |
|6      |   +,-      |          L-R|
|7      |   <<,>>     |         L-R |
|8      |   (bitwise and)   |     L-R     |
|9      |   (bitwise xor)   | L-R         |
|10     |   (bitwise or)   |     L-R     |
|11     |   in, not in, is, is not, <, <=, >, >=, !=, ==     |  L-R       |
|12     |   not       |     R-L     |
|13     |   and    |      L-R    |
|14     |   or  |      L-R    |
|15     |   if else ( conditional expression )      |    R-L     |
|16     |   =      |R-L         |  

#### `points to be noted from above table`

- The most priority goes to brackets `()`.
- the least priority goes to `=` equal to.
- Most of the operators follows `L->R` approach.
- Where as some operators follows `R->L` and they are.
  - `**`
  - `+x, -x` | unary plus and unary minus
  - logical not  `not` | eg: `print( not not not True )`

##### list of operators

- =
  - a,b = 1,2
- arithmetic operator `( +, -, *, /, //, % ) and **`
  - unary +, unary - : it is called unary +, - because it has only one operand.
  - +,- ( addition and subtraction )
  - *, / ( division ), // ( floor division ), % ( modulus )
    - `2+3+5`
    - `2+3*5`
  - **

###### `most use cases of modulus operator`

- get remaining values
  - in 100 seconds , we can say 1 minutes and remaining 40 seconds there.
  - how to get this 40 remaining seconds.
  - `100//60` -> 1   | `gives how many times you can divide 100 by 60`
  - `100%60`  -> 40  | `gives remaining values that will left after dividing 100 by 60`
- get last digit

---

Below example shows how you can remove each digit one by one in a number.

```python
>>> 1234 % 10  # 4
>>> 1234 // 10 # 123
>>> 123 % 10   # 3
>>> 123 // 10  # 12
>>> 12 % 10    # 2
```

- repeat an index value within its limit

```python
>>> li = [ 10, 20, 30 ]
>>> n = len(li) # 3
>>> i = 0
>>> li[ i%n ] # 0%3
>>> i = i + 1
>>> li[ i%n ] # 1%3
>>> i = i + 1
>>> li[ i%n ] # 2%3
>>> i = i + 1
>>> li[ i%n ] # 3%3
>>> i = i + 1
>>> li[ i%n ] # 4%3
>>> i = i + 1
```

---
üôÄ EXTRA : üôÄ

```python
>>> a = 5%2 # 
>>> a = -5%2 # 
>>> a = 5%-2 # 
>>> a = -5%-2 # 
```

- while using modulus operator, result sign will be same as denominator sign.

---

### `Exponent operator ( ** )`

- usage is purely on maths.
- find square root and cube root

```python
>>> 2**3   #
>>> 2**1   #
>>> 2**-1  #
>>> 2**0.5   # square root
>>> 3**(1/3) # cube root
```

```python
# other examples 
# ( try below example to try to find why we got that output )
>>> 4**2
>>> 5*4**2
>>> -3**2
>>> (-3)**2
>>> 4**0.5
>>> 4**-0.5
>>> 4**-2
```

`usage`

- square root
- cube root
  - math.ceil
  - math.floor

---
üôÄ EXTRA : üôÄ out of scope

```python
>>>  -3**2
```

---

### `comment`

- where to use, Consider a scenario where you don't want to execute a line of codes.
- The developers uses comments that will restrict the execution of such code.
- Some times, developers use comments to explain below codes.

```python
a = 10 # a is assigned with value 10
b = 20
# In below code 
# - we are doing addition operation
# - and storing in variable c
c = a + b
print(c)
```

- why in python we use # for comments
- why not `//` for comments | in c, cpp, java, javascript we use `//` for comments
- because already `//` has been used for `floor division`

---

### `Data types`

```md
     Data types
       /      \
  Numberic    string datatype
  /                \
int               str
float
bool
complex     
```

### `int`

1. +ve, =ve, 0 are called `int`
1. size/range is dependent on machine

```python
# some times you want to store money information in code
amount = 1,00,000 # 1 lakh
print(amount) # (1,0,0)

# you can make above code readable by using underscore.
amount = 1_00_000
print(amount) # 100000
# üí°NOTES:
# - only point is use underscore(_) in-between the digits
# - not in front or rear of digits.
```

- you can represent binary, octal, hexadecimal in integer

```python
# you can use both small and capital letters ( b, B, x, X, o, O )
a = 0b1010 # (or) 0B1010
print(a) # 10
b = 0o10 # (or) 0O10
print(b) # 8
c = 0xA  # (or) 0XA
print(c) # 10
```

### `float`

- float will follow double precision
- float data will only follow "decimal representation"
- `0b10.10` is wrong becase, here this is meaning less,
  - and in python you can use 0b, 0B, 0x, 0X, 0o, 0O in integer type only.
- `1e3` mean `1*10**3`, 1 multiple of 10 to power of 3

```python
# rare examples
# below is actually type conversion
>>> float("inf") 
inf
>>> float("-inf")
-inf
>>> float("-inf") * 10
-inf
>>> float("nan")
nan
>>> float("infinity")
inf

# in python we can represent infinite like this.
```

### `complex`

- This is all about complex numbers which comes under subject `math`
- examples of valid complex numbers
  - `5+3j`
  - `5-3j`
  - `3j`
  - `5+3J`
  - `3.5+3J`
  - `3.5+6J`
  - `0b1010 + 21j`
  - `0x13 + 0x13J`

```python
a = 7 + 9j
print(a.real) # 7.0
print(a.imag) # 9.0
```

```python
v1 = 4 + 5j
v2 = 6 + 3j
print(v1 + v2)
print(v1 - v2)
print(v1 * v2)
print(v1 / v2)
print(v1 // v2) # ERROR üíÄ. can use // in complex 
```

### `strings`

- in python there is no data type like 'char' ( character )
- Because in c, cpp we have a data type called 'char'
- In python we can create/represent string in following ways.
  - single quotes `'`
  - double quotes `"`
  - triple quotes
    - 3 single quotes `'''`
    - 3 double quotes `"""`

```python
# valid ways to create a string in python
a = 'h'
a = "h"
a = "hello"
a = "" # empty string
a = " " # a single space in string
a = '''line 1
line 2
line 3
line 4
''' # we use triple quotes to store string in that can 
# be written in multiple lines
a = "don't" # outside - " and inside - '
a = 'I will never "give up"' # outside - ' and inside - "
a = 'hai\nhello\twhat\'\"\\' # these are escape sequences
```

`ADDITIONAL NOTES`

##### REPL

REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop. It is an interactive programming environment that takes user inputs (one at a time), evaluates them, and returns the result to the user. This process is repeated in a loop, hence the name "Read-Eval-Print Loop."
