## problem 05

You are given a mobile number that may either:
- Have 10 digits (standard mobile number), or
- Have 12 digits (including the country code "91").
    
    Your task is to
    
    1. Ignore the country code if it is present. If the
    number has 12 digits, only the last 10 digits (i.e.,
    the actual mobile number) should be considered
    for further processing.

    2. Split the 10-digit mobile number into two parts:
        - Left part: The first 5 digits of the 10-digit mobile number.
        - Right part: The last 5 digits of the 10-digit mobile number.

    3. Create a new number by swapping the two parts:
        - The right part of the number will become
        the left part of the new number.
        - The left part of the number will become
        the right part of the new number.
